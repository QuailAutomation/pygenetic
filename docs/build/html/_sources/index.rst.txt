=====================================

Introduction
============

	Efficient Python Genetic Algorithm Framework provides its users a highly efficient and usable way to explore the problem solving ability of Genetic Algorithms. It seeks to reduce the task of solving a problem using genetic algorithms to just choosing the appropriate operators and values which are provided internally. Further, support is also provided for a user to input his own operators for variation or for solving more specific problems.
	Students, teachers, researchers, company employees / entrepreneurs can all use our genetic algorithm framework while experimenting with different Machine Learning Algorithms and observing performance. They can also play around and simulate different Genetic Algorithms online on our website.


Modules
=======

GAEngine Module 
---------------

	"Contains GAEngine Class which is the main driver program which contains and invokes the operators used in Genetic algorithm
	GAEngine keeps track of specific type of operators the user has specified for running the algorithm"

Instance Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	fitness_func : A function argument
				The fitness function to be used, passed as a function argument
	
	fitness_threshold : int
				Threshold at which a candidate solution is considered optimal solution to the problem
	
	factory : Instance of any subclass of ChromosomeFactory class 
				Generates and returns the initial population of candidate solutions
	
	population_size : int
				The number of candidate solutions that can exist after every iteration
	
	cross_prob : float
				The Crossover probability of crossover operation which determines the extent to which crossover between parents
	
	mutation_prob : float
				The mutation probability of mutation operation which determines extent to which candidates should be mutated
	
	fitness_type : string
				Indicates the nature of fitness value (higher/lower/equal) to be considered during selection of candidates
				(default is max)
	
	adaptive_mutation : boolean
				If set rate of mutation of candidates dynamically changes during execution depending on diversity in population
				(default is true)

		a fitness score reaches a threshold or the number of iterations reach max iterations specified by user


ChromosomeFactory Module
------------------------

Class ChromosomeFactory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Abstract Class to be inherited for implemention of different 
	ways of generating initial population of chromosomes
	
	* Instance variables :
	
		data_type : type of data of each gene in chromosome

		noOfGenes : number of genes in each chromosome
	
	* Methods :
	
		createChromosome () : Abstract method to be implemented by derived classes



Class ChromosomeRegexFactory(ChromosomeFactory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	Class derived from ChromosomeFactory, implements the method createChromosome()
	which generates initial population of candidates by using regex module in python
	on genes

	* Instance variables :

		data_type : datatype of each gene
		
		noOfGenes : int ,  number of genes in each chromosome
		
		pattern : string containing individual genes

	* Methods :

		createChromosome() : Generates a chromosome from given genes using python regex module 
							
							Returns : chromosome : List containing individual genes of chromosome 


Class ChromosomeRangeFactory(ChromosomeFactory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Class derived from ChromosomeFactory, implements the method createChromosome()
	which generates initial population of candidates by randomly sampling genes from a 
	range of genes


	* Instance variables :

		data_type : datatype of each gene

		noOfGenes : int , number of genes in each chromosome
		
		minValue : int , lower bound of range
		
		maxValue : int , upper bound of range
		
		duplicates : boolean , indicates if gene can be repeated in chromosome

	* Methods :

		createChromosome(self) : Generates a chromosome by randomly sampling genes from a given range
							
								Returns : chromosome : List of genes representing each chromosome 




Evolution Module
----------------

Class Base Evolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Abstract class to be inherited to implement the specific evolution procedure

	* Instance Members :
	
	max_iterations : int
	
	* Methods :
	
	evolve() : abstract method to be implemeted by derived classes



Class StandardEvolution(BaseEvolution)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


	Class inherits from BaseEvolution and contain implementations of abstract 
	evolution method in  BaseEvolution
	
	* Instance Members :

	max_iterations : int
	
	adaptive_mutation : boolean to indicated if rate of mutation should 
						change dynamically during each iteration
	pyspark : boolean to indicated if parallelization should be supported by using pyspark



	1) __evolve_normal(self,ga):

		"""
		Private method which performs an iteration

		Outline of Algorithm :
		
		Selection : fittest members of population are selected by invoking 
					selection handler in Utils.py module

		Crossover : A probability score is generated from fitness value of each chromosome
					Chromosomes for crossover are selected based on this probablity score 
					of each chromosome
					Crossover is performed by invoking a crossover handler from Utils.py

		Mutation : If adaptive mutation is set then average square deviation of fitness values
					is used for determining (the indexes of chromosome)/genes to be mutated 
					If false then genes to be mutated are chosen randomly
					Once indexes of Chromomsome / genes to be mutated are determined, a mutation
					handler from Utils.py module is invoked 

		Each iteration consists of repeating the above operations until an optimal solution 
		determined by fitness threshold is reached  or number of iterations specified are complete


	2) evolve()

		Invokes the private method __evolve_normal to perform an iteration Genetic Algorithm
		
		Returns : 1 if optimal solution was found
