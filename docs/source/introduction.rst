Introduction
============

	Efficient Python Genetic Algorithm Framework provides its users a highly efficient and usable way to explore the problem solving ability of Genetic Algorithms. It seeks to reduce the task of solving a problem using genetic algorithms to just choosing the appropriate operators and values which are provided internally. Further, support is also provided for a user to input his own operators for variation or for solving more specific problems.
	Students, teachers, researchers, company employees / entrepreneurs can all use our genetic algorithm framework while experimenting with different Machine Learning Algorithms and observing performance. They can also play around and simulate different Genetic Algorithms online on our website.
